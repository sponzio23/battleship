- initialize game (DONE)
    - create variables
    - explain rules (not quite finished)
    - create boards
    - choose 1 or 2 players

- create computer ships (DONE)
    - for loop for number of ships to place
    - for each ship, pick random coordinates on a 10/10 grid
    - check if that coordinate is taken, if is repeat
    - if not set that coordinate to a 1

- create player ships (DONE)
    - player selects where to place each ship
    - check if it overlaps
    - repeat * 5

- battle
    - player picks shot
    - check if is hit or miss and output
    - store hit value (this will be tricky)
    - computer randomly picks shot (random at first but could add strategy later)
    - check if is hit or miss and output
    - store hit value (this will be tricky)

    TO DO:
    - check for if game is over

- finish (TO DO)
    - thank you for playing
    - add a loop to repeat

- tools to use
    - the whole game should be in a while loop
    - board should be a 2d array
    - ships should use inheritance?
    - creating player and computer ships should both use loops
    - in fact everything should be a loop to account for stupid players
    - how do i check if ships have been sunk


- logic for checkWin()
    default value of player won to true
    for each single cell
        if the value for the cell is 1 player won is false
