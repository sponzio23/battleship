- initialize game
    - create variables
    - explain rules
    - create boards
    - choose 1 or 2 players
- create computer ships
    - randomly select location for ship
    - check if it overlaps
    - repeat * 5
- create player ships (for initial troubleshooting this should also be computer)
    - player selects where to place each ship
    - check if it overlaps
    - repeat * 5
- battle
    - player picks shot
    - check if is hit or miss and output
    - store hit value (this will be tricky)
    - computer randomly picks shot (random at first but could add strategy later)
    - check if is hit or miss and output
    - store hit value (this will be tricky)
    - check for if game is over
- finish
    - thank you for playing
    - add a loop to repeat
- tools to use
    - the whole game should be in a while loop
    - board should be a 2d array
    - ships should use inheritance?
    - creating player and computer ships should both use loops
    - in fact everything should be a loop to account for stupid players
    - how do i check if ships have been sunk
