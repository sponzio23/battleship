major changes:
    no need for scanners, need to be changed to dialogues
    no need for print, need to be changed to fields maybe? or labels? idk
    still going to use arrays, need to test if they can be printed

create a window
welcome to battleship
check for rules, output them if selected

other than inputs setVars() should be very much the same


planning for main window:

WELCOME TO BATTLESHIP

Start Game Button
    display rules dialog
    display variables dialog

Always have a button to display player board and ships

It's your turn to shoot (button)

It's the computer's turn to shoot
